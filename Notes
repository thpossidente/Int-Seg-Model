- Implement Time Delay on temporal layers instead of modified hebbian trace update. 
    - Time delay: including previous activation values along with currect activation values (for as many previous passes as you want).
    - Must store previous n activation vectors then use them to calculate output as well as current activations
    
- Sparesness with split network must be changed
